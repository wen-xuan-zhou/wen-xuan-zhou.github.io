Regular expressions (regex) extract information from text by searching for matches of a specific pattern.

Regex is very helpful for editing strings and cleaning data in Python. The same syntax could be applied to other programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, C / C++, Perl, Ruby, R, and many others. 

Below is a table containing the most used symbols in regex.

Let's look at some examples. 

Here's a sentence: "We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking." How could I extract the numbers into a list? Regex is one answer!

```{python}
import re

string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking."

re.findall(r"\d+",string1)
```

First, I need to import the re library. re.findall() returns all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, it returns a list of groups. For the regex, I write '\\d+', which extracts the numbers with one or more digits in the string. 

Let's look at another example. 

Extract all the url links in the following string: "<http://www.classmates.com/go/e/200988231/CC123101BT/CM00>  <http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/spacer.gif>  <http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/sp \

re.findall(r"http://[^ \t\n\r\f\v>]+",string2)
```
This regex helps me to find all the url links start with the pattern "http://" followed by one or more characters that are non-whitespace and are not ">". This is an example that shows regex is very useful in extracting important information in a long text!

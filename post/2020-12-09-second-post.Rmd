There's time when we want to use both Python and R at the same time to solve problems. How could we make it work so that Python and R could talk to each other? One way to address this issue is to use reticulate. Reticulate allows us to share things between Python and R. 

For example, dataset imported through R could also be accessed by Python.

Here's a R code chunk
```{r}
library(datasets)

iris <- iris
```
Here's a Python code chunk
```{python}
r.iris
```

Notice the first row is labeled ## 0. Python could now read the dataset iris in R!

This will also work in reverse with some minor changes!

      <description>There&#39;s time when we want to use both Python and R at the same time to solve problems. How could we make it work so that Python and R could talk to each other? One way to address this issue is to use reticulate. Reticulate allows us to share things between Python and R.
For example, dataset imported through R could also be accessed by Python.
Here&#39;s a R code chunk</description>

      <description>Regular expressions (regex) extract information from text by searching for matches of a specific pattern.
Regex is very helpful for editing strings and cleaning data in Python. The same syntax could be applied to other programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, C / C++, Perl, Ruby, R, and many others.
Below is a table containing the most used symbols in regex.
Let&#39;s look at some examples.
Here&#39;s a sentence: &amp;quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314&#39;,&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task.</description>
